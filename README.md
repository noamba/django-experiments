In this small (and still developing) project I want to play with Python, Django, MySQL, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc. I also wanted to deploy the outcome to the web. I started with a dataset that includes 70,000 clothing items in csv format. 
Following steps included:
* Creating a Django app
* Creating a MySQL database
* Transforming the datatset to normalized Django models (see models)
* Creating objects and saving them in the MySQL database (see the script that does that)
