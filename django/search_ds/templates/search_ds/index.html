    <p>In this small (and still developing) project I wanted to: </p> 
    <ul>
      <li> Build a website with Python, Django, MySQL, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc. using Git and Github</li>
      <li> Have this website render nicely on all devices including mobiles and tablets</li>
      <li> Explore Python and relevant technologies such as Cython and Google Charts using a larg-ish dataset</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    For more details on how this website was set up, click <a href="{% url 'setting_up_the_website' %}">here</a>.
    See <a href="{% url 'top_brand_graph' %}">here</a> how a large-ish dataset was used for a short exploration
    of Django's ORM, Google Charts, Javascript and jQuery. Finally, <a href="{% url 'data_structures_and_cython' %}">check out</a> 
    the how optimizing the data structure and using Cython sped up 
    the search within this dataset by more than 10 times(!).
