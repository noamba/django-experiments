    <p>In this small (yet still developing) project I wanted to: </p> 
    <ul>
      <li> Explore Python and relevant technologies such as Cython and Google Charts using a larg-ish dataset</li>
      <li> Build a website with Python, Django, MySQL, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc. using Git and Github</li>
      <li> Have this website render nicely on all devices including mobiles and tablets</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    So, you are welcome to check out how a large-ish dataset was used in a short exploration of 
    <a href="{% url 'top_brand_graph' %}">Django's ORM, Google Charts, Javascript and jQuery</a>. 
    See how  
    <a href="{% url 'data_structures_and_cython' %}">profiling, optimizing Python's data structure and using Cython</a> sped up 
    searching within this dataset by more than 10 times(!).   
    And, for more details on how this website was set up, click <a href="{% url 'setting_up_the_website' %}">here</a>.
